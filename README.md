# Challenges and accomplishments
Our challenge was to create something funny and useful at the same time.  
And we were inspired by the book.  
We accomplished to create an app that uses APIs to get an poet from popular authors. And than compare it with the worst Poetry by official Hitchinker's guide to the galaxy.  
For those who like to see beautifull things like rainbow, you can hunt it and use our website which tells you in what time you can see the rainbow.

# Next Steps
